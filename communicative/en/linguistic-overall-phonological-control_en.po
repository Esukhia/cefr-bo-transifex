"C2_Can employ the full range of phonological features in the target language "
"with a high level of control – including prosodic features such as word and "
"sentence stress, rhythm and intonation – so that the finer points of their "
"message are clear and precise. Intelligibility and effective conveyance and "
"enhancement of meaning are not affected in any way by features of accent "
"that may be retained from other language(s)."

"C1_Can employ the full range of phonological features in the target language "
"with sufficient control to ensure intelligibility throughout. Can articulate "
"virtually all the sounds of the target language; some features of accent(s) "
"retained from other language(s) may be noticeable, but they do not affect "
"intelligibility."

"A2_Pronunciation is generally clear enough to be understood, but "
"conversational partners will need to ask for repetition from time to time. A "
"strong influence from the other language(s) they speak on stress, rhythm and "
"intonation may affect intelligibility, requiring collaboration from "
"interlocutors. Nevertheless, pronunciation of familiar words is clear."

"A1_Pronunciation of a very limited repertoire of learnt words and phrases "
"can be understood with some effort by interlocutors used to dealing with "
"speakers of the language group. Can reproduce correctly a limited range of "
"sounds as well as stress for simple, familiar words and phrases."
