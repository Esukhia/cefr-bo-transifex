"C2_Has a good command of idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms with "
"awareness of connotative levels of "
"meaning. Can convey finer shades of meaning precisely by using, with "
"reasonable accuracy, a wide range of modification devices. Can backtrack and "
"restructure around a difficulty so smoothly that the interlocutor is hardly "
"aware of it."

"C1_Can express themselves fluently and spontaneously, almost effortlessly. "
"Has a good command of a broad lexical repertoire allowing gaps to be readily "
"overcome with circumlocutions. There is little obvious "
"searching for expressions or avoidance strategies; only a conceptually "
"difficult subject can hinder a natural, "
"smooth flow of language."

"B2+_Can use the language fluently, accurately and effectively on a wide "
"range of general, academic, vocational "
"or leisure topics, marking clearly the relationships between ideas. Can "
"communicate spontaneously with "
"good grammatical control without much sign of having to restrict what they "
"want to say, adopting a level "
"of formality appropriate to the circumstances."

msgid ""
"B2_Can interact with a degree of fluency and spontaneity that makes regular "
"interaction, and sustained relationships with users of the target language, "
"quite possible without imposing strain on either party. Can highlight the "
"personal significance of events and experiences, and account for and sustain "
"views clearly by providing relevant explanations and arguments."

"B1+_Can communicate with some confidence on familiar routine and non-routine "
"matters related to their interests and professional field. Can exchange, "
"check and confirm information, deal with less routine situations and explain "
"why something is a problem. Can express thoughts on more abstract, cultural "
"topics such as films, books, music, etc."

msgid ""
"B1_Can exploit a wide range of simple language to deal with most situations "
"likely to arise while travelling. "
"Can enter unprepared into conversation on familiar topics, and express "
"personal opinions and exchange information on topics that are familiar, of "
"personal interest or pertinent to everyday life (e.g. family, "
"hobbies, work, travel and current events)."

"A2+_Can interact with reasonable ease in structured situations and short "
"conversations, provided the other "
"person helps if necessary. Can manage simple, routine exchanges without "
"undue effort; can ask and answer questions and exchange ideas and "
"information on familiar topics in predictable everyday "
"situations."

#: oral-overall_en.txt:30
msgid ""
"A2_Can communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a simple and direct "
"exchange of information on "
"familiar and routine matters to do with work and free time. Can handle very "
"short social exchanges but is "
"rarely able to understand enough to keep conversation going of their own "
"accord."

#: oral-overall_en.txt:32
msgid ""
"A1_Can interact in a simple way but communication is totally dependent on "
"repetition at a slower rate, rephrasing and repair. Can ask and answer "
"simple questions, initiate and respond to simple statements in areas of "
"immediate need or on very familiar topics."
msgstr ""

#: oral-overall_en.txt:33
msgid ""
"Pre-A1_Can ask and answer questions about themselves and daily routines, "
"using short, formulaic expressions and relying on gestures to reinforce the "
"information."
